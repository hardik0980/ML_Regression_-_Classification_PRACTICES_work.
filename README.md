## 1. Linear Regression || Housing price Prediction

      Load the housing_price.csv dataset to a DataFrame and perform the following tasks:
The housing_price dataset contains all numeric data and the median_house_value column is our target variable, so with help of linear regression build a model that can predict accurate house prices.
Perform the below task and build a model.

1. Load the housing_price dataset into DataFrame
2. Find the null value and drop it, if it is there
3. Split x and y into train and test data set based on test size as 0.2 and random_state as 10
4. Call the LinearRegression model then fit the model using train data
5. Print R2 vallue, coefficient and intercept
6. Compare actual and predicted values.
7.Print the final summary
